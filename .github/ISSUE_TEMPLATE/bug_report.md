    This issue template is REQUIRED for all bug reports. It helps us more
    quickly track, narrow down, and address bugs. 

    Bug reports not adhering to this template will be likely marked invalid and
    closed as there is very little we can do without the requisite information.

    Thank you for understanding!

## Description
<!-- What went wrong? Be clear and concise. -->

## Expected behavior
<!-- What did you *want* to happen? -->

## Environment
<!--
    This part is incredibly important:

    Please run the following shell command in the OpenLane root folder:

        python3 ./env.py issue-survey

    Then copy and paste the ENTIRE output between the triple-backticks below. (```)

    If the command does not succeed, you are using an out-of-date version of
    OpenLane, and it is recommended that you update.

## Reproduction Material
<!--
    You have two options here:

    A. If you see a message like `Reproducible packaged: Please tarball and
       upload <PATH> if you're going to submit an issue` in your logs,
       please also tarball and include that path. The reproducible tarball is
       absolutely required for OpenROAD bugs.

    B. If you don't...
        * Upload a tarball containing the relevant design.
        * List the commands used to run the design.

## Logs

    Please do ensure they're inside the triple-backticks. (```)
