        This part is incredibly important:

        Please run the following shell command in the OpenLane root folder:

            python3 ./env.py issue-survey

        Then copy and paste the ENTIRE output in the text field below.

        If the command does not succeed, you are using an out-of-date version of OpenLane, and it is recommended that you update.

      render: shell
      description: Please paste the output from the previous command. It will be automatically formatted into code, so no need for backticks.

The reproducible tarball is 100% required for OpenROAD bugs.

        2. If you don't...
