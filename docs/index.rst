OpenLANE
========

OpenLANE is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components 
including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, Fault, OpenPhySyn, SPEF-Extractor 
and custom methodology scripts for design exploration and optimization. 
The flow performs full ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII - 
this capability will be released in the coming weeks with completed 
SoC design examples that have been sent to SkyWater for fabrication.
