# Porting a PDK
This readme describes how to structure a PDK for use with OpenLane.

## Folder structure
This is the expected folder structure for a PDK:

- <pdk_name>
	- libs.tech
		- openlane
			- config.tcl
			- common_pdn.tcl
			- `<standard cell library>`
				- config.tcl
				- tracks.info
				- no_synth.cells
				- drc_exclude.cells
	- libs.ref
		- lef
		- techLEF
		- lib

## Configuration files
- `config.tcl` PDK configuration file contains common information for all standard cell libraries under this PDK
- `common_pdn.tcl` Pdn configuration file. Refer to PDN configuration [section](#pdn-configuration-file).
- `<standard cell library>/config.tcl` standard cell library configuration file which contains information specific to that SCL. It can override PDK configuration file.
- `<standard cell library>/tracks.info` Contains information about the metal layers offsets and pitches. Refer to tracks configuration file [section](#tracks-info-file)
- `<standard cell library>/no_synth.cells` that should contain the list of newline-separated cell names to trim during synthesis (to not use them in synthesis). More in this [section](#no-synthesis-cells-file).

## Tracks Info File

The tracks files defines the metal layers pitches and offsets. This information should be extracted from the PDK's tech lef. The following is the format of the files

```
<layer name> X|Y <offset> <pitch>
```


## PDN Configuration File

A sample PDN configuration file exists [here](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks/blob/master/sky130/openlane/common_pdn.tcl).

More on the structure of the file [here](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/blob/master/src/pdn/doc/PDN.md)

## No Synthesis Cells File

There are some cell types that you don't want to use in synthesis like, for example, delay cells and clock buffers (since CTS is a separate step that would insert the clock buffers).

Also, other cells don't have a default mapping in yosys, so they were excluded to reduce the liberty file size until we add a tech mapping file for each.

The smallest sizes of the cells were also removed to prevent the synthesizer from using them, which allows for a larger floorplan. These cells however are accessible by the optimizer which will in turn replace the bigger cells with these smaller sizes when needed. Eventually, this process will produce clean routing without forcing the users of OpenLane to re-configure their designs with smaller `FP_CORE_UTIL` and `PL_TARGET_DENSITY` values. Nonetheless, this change will come some time in the future.

However, this list is likely over-constraining, and if you have done experiments allowing smaller sizes incrementally and still got clean routed layouts, please let us know your findings, or better yet, submit a pull request at [open_pdks](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks) with a suggested no_synth list.


This list is only used during synthesis.

You can also point your custom no_synth.cells by setting the value for `NO_SYNTH_CELL_LIST` to point to it.


## DRC Exclude Cells File

Some of the cells, back when this list was created, had hard-to-access pin shapes, so the detailed router didn't manage to do routing cleanly.

Others had DRC violations within the cell definitions.

We excluded all cells of size _0 for the same reasons explained in the previous section.

The lpflow cells were also excluded because the flow is still unable to deal with them and connect a KAPWR supply.

This list is used for both synthesis and timing optimizations.

You can also point your custom no_synth.cells by setting the value for `DRC_EXCLUDE_CELL_LIST` to point to it.
