Docker Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next, install Docker.
Follow `the instructions provided in the documentation of the Docker  here <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/>`_ as the steps provided below might be outdated.

.. warning::
    The steps below might be simply outdated, it is encouraged to follow the link to the official Docker documentation


.. code-block::

   # Remove old installations
   sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
   # Installation of requirements
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install \
      ca-certificates \
      curl \
      gnupg \
      lsb-release
   # Add the keyrings of docker
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
   # Add the package repository
   echo \
      "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
      $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
   # Update the package repository
   sudo apt-get update

   # Install Docker
   sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin

   # Check for installation
   sudo docker run hello-world


Successful installation of Docker looks like this:

.. code-block::

   Hello from Docker!
   This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

   To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
   1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
   2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub. (amd64)
   3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
   4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

   To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
   $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
