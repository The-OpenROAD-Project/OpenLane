============
PDK Support
============

The major component of physical design is PDK (Process Design Kit). The
OpenROAD application is PDK independent. However it is tested and
validated with specific PDKs in the context of various flow controllers.

The OpenROAD supports both public and private PDKs including:

Open Source PDK
---------------

-  Skywater 130 nm
-  Nangate45
-  ASAP7 - Predictive FinFET 7nm



OpenLane with SkyWater Sky130-PDK
---------------------------------

The SkyWater Open Source PDK is a collaboration between Google and
SkyWater Technology Foundry to provide a fully open source Process
Design Kit and related resources, which can be used to create
manufacturable designs at SkyWaterâ€™s facility.

The SkyWater Open Source PDK documentation can be found at

Open Source Tools:
------------------

The OpenRoad Openlane is a automated RTL to GDSII flow build around open
source tool. The flow perform the auto place and route of an ASIC design
-in 24 hours with no human in the loop. Tool used in OpenLane are listed
below:

1.  **Synthesis**

    -  ``yosys`` - Performs RTL synthesis
    -  ``abc`` - Performs technology mapping
    -  ``OpenSTA`` - Performs static timing analysis on the resulting
       netlist to generate timing reports

2.  **Floor planning**

    -  ``init_fp`` - Defines the core area for the macro as well as the
       rows (used for placement) and the tracks (used for routing)
    -  ``ioplacer`` - Places the macro input and output ports
    -  ``pdn`` - Generates the power distribution network
    -  ``tap cell`` - Inserts well tap in the floor plan

3.  **Placement**

    -  ``RePLace`` - Performs global placement
    -  ``Resizer`` - Performs optional optimizations on the design
    -  ``OpenDP`` - Performs detailed placement to legalize the globally
       placed components

4.  **Clock Tree Synthesis**

    -  ``TritonCTS`` - Synthesizes the clock distribution network (the
       clock tree)

5.  **Routing**

    -  ``FastRoute`` - Performs global routing to generate a guide file
       for the detailed router
    -  ``CU-GR`` - Another option for performing global routing.
    -  ``TritonRoute`` - Performs detailed routing
    -  ``SPEF-Extractor`` - Performs SPEF extraction

6.  **GDSII Generation**

    -  ``Magic`` - Streams out the final GDSII layout file from the
       routed def
    -  ``Klayout`` - Streams out the final GDSII layout file from the
       routed def as a back-up

7.  **Checks**

    -  ``Magic``- Performs DRC Checks & Antenna Checks
    -  ``Klayout`` - Performs DRC Checks
    -  ``Netgen`` - Performs LVS Checks
