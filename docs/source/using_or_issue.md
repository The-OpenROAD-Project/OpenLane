# `or_issue.py`
This script creates a reproducible, self-contained package of files to demonstrate OpenROAD behavior in a vaccum, suitable for filing issues.

It outputs a tarball with a small run script that you can then submit as an issue to OpenROAD.

# Usage
You'll have to extract three key elements from the error:
* The Run Path -> run_path
* The Script Where The Failure Occurred -> script
* The Final Layout Before The Failure Occurred -> input

***All paths must be relative to the filesystem you're running or_issue.py in.***

As a practical example, for this log from flow_summary.txt:

```log
[INFO]: Changing layout from /openlane/designs/spm/runs/config_TEST_fastestTestSet1/results/cts/spm.cts.def to /openlane/designs/spm/runs/config_TEST_fastestTestSet1/tmp/placement/12-resizer_timing.def
[...]
[INFO]: Running Global Routing...
[INFO]: current step index: 15
[INFO]: Changing layout from /openlane/designs/spm/runs/config_TEST_fastestTestSet1/tmp/placement/12-resizer_timing.def to /openlane/designs/spm/runs/config_TEST_fastestTestSet1/tmp/routing/15-fastroute.def
```

The three elements would be:
* run_path: `./designs/spm/runs/config_TEST_fastestTestSet1`
* input:    `./designs/spm/runs/config_TEST_fastestTestSet1/tmp/placement/12-resizer_timing.def`
* script:   `./scripts/openroad/or_groute.tcl`

Then you'd want to run this script as follows, from the root of the OpenLane Repo:
```sh
    python3 ./or_issue.py\
        -s  ./scripts/openroad/or_groute.tcl\
        -i  ./designs/spm/runs/config_TEST_fastestTestSet1/tmp/placement/12-resizer_timing.def\
            ./designs/spm/runs/config_TEST_fastestTestSet1
```

Which will create a folder called `_build`, with two entries:
* `config_TEST_fastestTestSet1_or_groute_packaged/`: A folder for human inspection
* `config_TEST_fastestTestSet1_or_groute_packaged.tar.gz`: A gzipped tarball of that same folder.

Ensure that you inspect this folder manually and the output of this script. This script only attempts a best effort, and it is very likely that it might miss something, in which case, feel free to file an issue.

You can then verify that the script worked by running:
```sh
    cd _build/config_TEST_fastestTestSet1_or_groute_packaged
    ./run
```

You can override the OpenROAD binary used as follows:

```sh
    cd _build/config_TEST_fastestTestSet1_or_groute_packaged
    OPENROAD_BIN=/usr/local/bin/whatever ./run
```

# Warning about proprietary files

When working with a proprietary PDK, also inspect the tarball and ensure no proprietary data resulting ends up in there. This is *critical*, if something leaks, this scripts' authors take no responsibility and you are very much on your own. We will try our best to output warnings for your own good if something looks like a part of a proprietary PDK, but the absence of this message does not necessarily indicate that your folder and tarball are free of confidential material.
