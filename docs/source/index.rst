The OpenLane Documentation
==========================
OpenLane is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, SPEF-Extractor, KLayout and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization. It also provides a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization.

The flow performs all ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII. Currently, it supports both A and B variants of the sky130 PDK, the C variant of the gf180mcu PDK, and instructions to add support for other (including proprietary) PDKs are documented.

OpenLane abstracts the underlying open source utilities, and allows users to configure all their behavior with just a single configuration file.
