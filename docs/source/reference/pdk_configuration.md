# PDK Configuration Variables

These variables are defined by PDK configuration files to support the OpenLane
flow and its steps.

All these variables (unless marked optional) are defined by the PDK, but some may
also be overriden by a user configuration.

```{note}
Any examples provided are for the `sky130A` PDK.
```

## User-Modifiable

These values may be modified by the user configuration and the
included values should be considered "defaults."

## Tracks Info File

The tracks files defines the metal layers pitches and offsets. This information
should be extracted from the PDK's tech lef. The file should be an EOL-delimited
set of lines formatted as follows:

```
<layer name> X|Y <offset> <pitch>
```

## DRC Exclude Cells File

Some cells may be excluded from PnR entirely- due to hard-to-access pin shapes
and/or the cells simply being invalid (DRC violations.)

```{note}
For sky130, the "lpflow" cells were also excluded because the flow is unable
to handle them properly and create a keep-alive power (KAPWR) supply.
```

The file is formatted as an EOL-delimited list of cell names (wildcards and
the like not supported.)

## No Synthesis Cells File

Some cells may be furtherexcluded from synthesis, for reasons including but not
limited to the following:

* Excluded from PnR, i.e., part of the DRC Exclude Cells.
* Clock Buffers: They are balanced and may introduce too much of a delay when
  not used for clock trees as part of CTS.
* Cells without default mapping: Cannot be used by Yosys.
* Smaller cell sizes: Prevents under-estimating the required floorplan.
  The resizer may later choose to use them.

The file is formatted as an EOL-delimited list of cell names (wildcards and
the like not supported.)

All cells excluded from PnR are also excluded from Synthesis.
