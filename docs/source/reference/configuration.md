> * Tim Edwards's Explanation on disabling hier gds: The following is an explanation by Tim Edwards, provided in a slack thread, on how this affects the GDS writing process: "Magic can take a very long time writing out GDS while checking hierarchical interactions in a standard cell layout. If your design is all digital, I recommend using "gds *hier write disable" before "gds write" so that it does not try to resolve hierarchical interactions (since by definition, standard cells are designed to just sit next to each other without creating DRC issues).  That can actually make the difference between a 20 hour GDS write and a 2 minute GDS write.  For a standard cell design that takes up the majority of the user space, a > 24 hour write time (without disabling the hierarchy checks) would not surprise me."

### On comma-delimited variables
:::{warning}
Comma-delimited variables such as `FP_PDN_MACRO_HOOK` and `GRT_OBS` must be expressed in a pretty unorthodox way in JSON for now, either:

```json
    "FP_PDN_MACRO_HOOKS": "first item, second item, third item"
```

or:

```json
    "FP_PDN_MACRO_HOOKS": [
        "first item,",
        "second item,",
        "third item"
    ]
```

You'll notice that even as an array, all items except for the last item must include a comma in the string itself.

This is an unfortunate limitation with how Tcl handles arrays, i.e., they're just whitespace-delimited strings.
