# The OpenLane Docker Image
Note: You probably shouldn't be here.

## Structure

There are two "families" of images: one is for building tools, and the other is for running tools.

The build family has a base image that contains all build dependencies and then a number of subimages named **builders** tasked with downloading all tools from source and building them.

The run family has a base image that contains all the running dependencies. There are a number of subimages named **runnables**, which copy the results from the builders and allows them to be runnable- those images are pushed to Docker Hub in the repository efabless/openlane-tools. Another image in the run family is the final OpenLane image, which has *all* the tools.

```
openlane-build-base
L cvc **builder**
L openroad_app **builder**
L [...]

openlane-run-base
L openlane
L cvc **runnable**
L openroad_app **runnable**
```

## Building the OpenLane Image
```bash
make # or make openlane # or make merge
```

## Updating a Tool Binary

You can build a tool runnable using the following command: `make build-<tool_name>`.

When you are doing that, presumably you want to build a different version of the tool than is shipped by default with the OpenLane docker image. For example,  suppose we would like to include OpenRoad's version of Yosys rather than one from https://github.com/yosyshq/yosys. We need to modify the file `tool_metadata.yml` that is located in `OpenLane/dependencies`. Here is an example of such a change:

```
- name: yosys
  repo: https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/yosys
  commit: bc027b2cae9a85b887684930705762fac720b529
  build: |
    make clean
    make PREFIX=$PREFIX config-gcc
    make PREFIX=$PREFIX -j$(nproc)
    make PREFIX=$PREFIX install
```

Be alert to the fact that if you mix and match different tool versions (i.e. different git commit hashes), you can possibly run into compatibility issues.

To list the available tools, `python3 ../dependencies/tool.py --containerized`, which is just essentially listing the contents of `tool_metadata.yml`.

Be sure to `make openlane` **in the `docker/` folder** after building any tool, which will create the final OpenLane image. This will create a new Docker image tagged, by default, `efabless/openlane:current`. You can override the name as follows (again, **in the `docker/` folder**):

```sh
    make openlane OPENLANE_IMAGE_NAME=whatever/whatever:whatever
```

## Running the newly created Docker image
OpenLane scripts depend upon a variety of different shell environment variables in order to run correctly. They are all conveniently set by using the `make mount` command at the root of the repository. However, if you just do that, it will spin up the original image and not the one you just created. In order to use your new Docker image, first set the shell varialble `OPENLANE_IMAGE_NAME` to the newly created image as follows (**in the root of the repository**):

```sh
    make mount OPENLANE_IMAGE_NAME=whatever/whatever:whatever
```

## Running as root
* For security reasons, we don't recommend the default root Docker installation. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/ for a safer Docker installation also supported by OpenLane.

By default `make mount` logs into the image with the user ID that is currently active. If you are running as an unprivileged user, you can use `make mount` to log in as root to the Docker image, but you will need to use `sudo` to do this. But, if you are depending on shell environment variables that you may have set during the current session they will be dropped by the `sudo` command. One way to pass those on to the sudo shell is to use the `-E` option. The following shows how you can do that:

```
    sudo -E make mount
```
