# OpenLANE Interactive Mode Commands

This page describes the list of commands available in openlane, their functionality, and their expected inputs and outputs.

**NOTE:** You must run the `prep` command before running any of the other commands, in order to have the necessary files and configurations loaded.

The Following list is available in the interactive mode: `./flow.tcl -interactive` and under:
```
% package require openlane 0.9
```
Which runs automatically when you enter the interactive mode.
