> * Tim Edwards's Explanation on disabling hier gds: The following is an explanation by Tim Edwards, provided in a slack thread, on how this affects the GDS writing process: "Magic can take a very long time writing out GDS while checking hierarchical interactions in a standard cell layout. If your design is all digital, I recommend using "gds *hier write disable" before "gds write" so that it does not try to resolve hierarchical interactions (since by definition, standard cells are designed to just sit next to each other without creating DRC issues).  That can actually make the difference between a 20 hour GDS write and a 2 minute GDS write.  For a standard cell design that takes up the majority of the user space, a > 24 hour write time (without disabling the hierarchy checks) would not surprise me."

| `FILL_INSERTION` | Enables fill cells insertion after cts (if enabled) .1 = Enabled, 0 = Disabled <br> (Default: `1`)|
| `TAP_DECAP_INSERTION` | Enables tap and decap cells insertion after floorplanning (if enabled) .1 = Enabled, 0 = Disabled <br> (Default: `1`) |
| `DIODE_INSERTION_STRATEGY` | Specifies the insertion strategy of diodes to be used in the flow. 0 = No diode insertion, 1 = Spray diodes, 2 = insert fake diodes and replace them with real diodes if needed. 3= use FastRoute Antenna Avoidance flow, 4 = Use Sylvian's Custom Script for diode insertion on design pins and smartly inserting needed diodes inside the design, 5 = a mix of strategy 2 and 4. <br> (Default: `3`) |
| `WIDEN_SITE` | Specifies the new virtual width of the site to be used in all stages up to diode insertion, then switched back to the original site width. It can be either a factor or an absolute value controlled by `WIDEN_SITE_IS_FACTOR` <br> (Default: `1`) |
| `WIDEN_SITE_IS_FACTOR` | Specifies whether the given `WIDEN_SITE` should be treated as a factor or an absolute value. 0 = absolute, 1 = factor <br> (Default: `1`) |
| `USE_ARC_ANTENNA_CHECK` | Specifies whether to use the openroad ARC antenna checker or magic antenna checker. 0=magic antenna checker, 1=ARC OR antenna checker <br> (Default: `1`)
| `RUN_SPEF_EXTRACTION` | Specifies whether or not to run SPEF extraction on the routed DEF. 1=enabled 0=disabled <br> Default: `1` |
| `SPEF_WIRE_MODEL` | Specifies the wire model used in SPEF extraction. Options are `L` or `Pi`  <br> Default: `L` |
| `SPEF_EDGE_CAP_FACTOR` | Specifies the edge capacitance factor used in SPEF extraction. Ranges from 0 to 1 <br> Default: `1` |
| `GENERATE_FINAL_SUMMARY_REPORT` | Specifies whether or not to generate a final summary report after the run is completed. Check command `generate_final_summary_report`. 1=enabled 0=disabled <br> Default: `1` |
| `MAGIC_CONVERT_DRC_TO_RDB` | Specifies whether or not generate a Calibre RDB out of the magic.drc report. Result is saved in `<run_path>/results/magic/`. 1=enabled 0=disabled <br> Default: `1`|
| `RUN_CVC` | Runs CVC on the output spice, which is a Circuit Validity Checker. Voltage aware ERC checker for CDL netlists. Thus, it controls the command `run_lef_cvc`. 1=Enabled, 0=Disabled. <br> Default: `1` |

### Checkers

| Variable      | Description                                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CHECK_UNMAPPED_CELLS` | Checks if there are unmapped cells after synthesis and aborts if any was found. 1 = Enabled, 0 = Disabled <br> (Default: `1`)|
| `CHECK_ASSIGN_STATEMENTS` | Checks for assign statement in the generated gate level netlist and aborts of any was found.1 = Enabled, 0 = Disabled <br> (Default: `0`)|
| `QUIT_ON_TR_DRC` | Checks for DRC violations after routing and exits the flow if any was found. 1 = Enabled, 0 = Disabled <br> (Default: `1`)|
| `QUIT_ON_MAGIC_DRC` | Checks for DRC violations after magic DRC is executed and exits the flow if any was found. 1 = Enabled, 0 = Disabled <br> (Default: `0`)|
| `QUIT_ON_ILLEGAL_OVERLAPS` | Checks for illegal overlaps during magic extraction. In some cases, these imply existing undetected shorts in the design. It also exits the flow if any was found. 1 = Enabled, 0 = Disabled <br> (Default: `1`)|
| `QUIT_ON_LVS_ERROR` | Checks for LVS errors after netgen LVS is executed and exits the flow if any was found. 1 = Enabled, 0 = Disabled <br> (Default: `0`)|
