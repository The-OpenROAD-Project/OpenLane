> * Tim Edwards's Explanation on disabling hier gds: The following is an explanation by Tim Edwards, provided in a slack thread, on how this affects the GDS writing process: "Magic can take a very long time writing out GDS while checking hierarchical interactions in a standard cell layout. If your design is all digital, I recommend using "gds *hier write disable" before "gds write" so that it does not try to resolve hierarchical interactions (since by definition, standard cells are designed to just sit next to each other without creating DRC issues).  That can actually make the difference between a 20 hour GDS write and a 2 minute GDS write.  For a standard cell design that takes up the majority of the user space, a > 24 hour write time (without disabling the hierarchy checks) would not surprise me."

| `NO_SYNTH_CELL_LIST` | Specifies the file that contains the don't-use-cell-list to be excluded from the liberty file during synthesis. If it's not defined, this path is searched `$::env(PDK_ROOT)/$::env(PDK)/libs.tech/openlane/$::env(STD_CELL_LIBRARY)/no_synth.cells` and if it's not found, then the original liberty will be used as is. |
| `DRC_EXCLUDE_CELL_LIST` | Specifies the file that contains the don't-use-cell-list to be excluded from the liberty file during synthesis and timing optimizations. If it's not defined, this path is searched `$::env(PDK_ROOT)/$::env(PDK)/libs.tech/openlane/$::env(STD_CELL_LIBRARY)/drc_exclude.cells` and if it's not found, then the original liberty will be used as is. In other words, `DRC_EXCLUDE_CELL_LIST` contain the only excluded cell list in timing optimizations. |
