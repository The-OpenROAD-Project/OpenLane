# Overview

OpenLANE is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, Fault and custom methodology scripts for design exploration and optimization. The flow performs full ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII - this capability will be released in the coming weeks with completed SoC design examples that have been sent to SkyWater for fabricaiton.


# Prerequisites
 
 - Docker (ensure docker daemon is running) -- tested with version 19.03.12, but any recent version should suffice
 - Magic VLSI Layout Tool is needed to run open_pdks -- version >= 8.3.25

For more details about the docker container and its process, the [following instructions][1] walk you through the process of using docker containers to build the needed tools then integrate them into OpenLANE flow.

# Setting up the PDK: skywater-pdk

- Clone and build one skywwater-pdk variant(s) inside the pdks directory:
    - To setup one variant only

    ```bash
        export PDK_ROOT=<absolute path to where skywater-pdk and open_pdks will reside>
	cd  $PDK_ROOT
        git clone git@github.com:google/skywater-pdk.git
        cd skywater-pdk
        git checkout 4e5e318e0cc578090e1ae7d6f2cb1ec99f363120
        git submodule update --init libraries/sky130_fd_sc_hd/latest
        make sky130_fd_sc_hd 
    ```
    - To setup other variants:
        - replace sky130_fd_sc_hd with any of the following list:
            - sky130_fd_sc_hs
            - sky130_fd_sc_ms
            - sky130_fd_sc_ls
            - sky130_fd_sc_hdll

- Setup the configurations and tech files for Magic, Netgen, OpenLANE using [open_pdks](https://github.com/efabless/open_pdks):
    
    ```bash
        cd $PDK_ROOT
	git clone git@github.com:efabless/open_pdks.git -b rc2
        cd open_pdks
        make
        make install-local
    ```

 - To set the PDK_VARIANT (the default value is set to sky130_fd_sc_hd)
    - Open [configuration/general.tcl](./configuration/general.tcl)
    - set PDK_VARIANT to one of the following: 

            - sky130_fd_sc_hs
            - sky130_fd_sc_ms
            - sky130_fd_sc_ls
            - sky130_fd_sc_hdll

Refer to [this][24] for more details on the structure.


# Setting up OpenLANE

```bash
    git clone git@github.com:efabless/openlane --branch rc2
    cd openlane/docker_build
    make merge
    cd ..
```
## Running OpenLANE

Issue the following command to open the docker container from path/to/openlane to ensure that the output files persist after exiting the container:


```bash
   docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) openlane:rc2
```

**Note: this will mount the openlane directory inside the container.**


Use the following example to check the overall setup:

```bash
./flow.tcl -design spm
```

To run OpenLANE on multiple designs at the same time, check this [section](#regression-and-design-configurations-exploration).

## Adding a design

To add a new design, follow the instructions provided [here](./designs/README.md)

This [file](./designs/README.md) also includes useful information about the design configuration files. It also includes useful utilities for exploring and updating design configurations for each (PDK,PDK_VARIANT) pair.

## OpenLANE Design Stages

OpenLANE flow consists of several stages. By default all flow steps are run in sequence. Each stage may consist of multiple sub-stages. OpenLANE can also be run interactively which will be shown below.

1. **Synthesis**
    1. `yosys` - Performs RTL synthesis
    2. `abc` - Performs technology mapping
    3. `OpenSTA` - Pefroms static timing analysis on the resulting netlist to generate timing reports
2. **Floorplan and PDN**
    1. `init_fp` - Defines the core area for the macro as well as the rows (used for placement) and the tracks (used for routing)
    2. `ioplacer` - Places the macro input and output ports
    3. `pdn` - Generates the power distribution network
    4. `tapcell` - Inserts welltap and decap cells in the floorplan
3. **Placement**
    1. `RePLace` - Performs global placement
    2. `Resizer` - Performs optional optimizations on the design
    3. `OpenDP` - Perfroms detailed placement to legalize the globally placed components
4. **CTS**
    1. `TritonCTS` - Synthesizes the clock distribution network (the clock tree)
5. **Routing** *
    1. `FastRoute` - Performs global routing to generate a guide file for the detailed router
    2. `TritonRoute` - Performs detailed routing
6. **GDSII Generation**
    1. `Magic` - Streams out the final GDSII layout file from the routed def
7. **Checks**
    1. `Magic` - Performs DRC Checks & Antenna Checks
    2. `Netgen` - Performs LVS Checks

OpenLANE integrated several key open source tools over the execution stages:
- RTL Synthesis, Technology Mapping, and Formal Verification : [yosys + abc][4]
- Static Timing Analysis: [OpenSTA][8]
- Floor Planning: [init_fp][5], [ioPlacer][6], [pdn][16] and [tapcell][7] 
- Placement: [RePLace][9] (Global), [Resizer][15] (Optimizations), and [OpenDP][10] (Detailed)
- Clock Tree Synthesis: [OpenROAD/TritonCTS][11]
- Fill Insertion: [OpenROAD/filler_placement][19]
- Routing: [FastRoute][12] (Global) and [TritonRoute][13] (Detailed)
- GDSII Streaming out: [Magic][14]
- DRC Checks: [Magic][14]
- LVS check: [Netgen][22]
- Antenna Checks: [Magic][14]

## OpenLANE Output

All output run data is placed by default under ./designs/design_name/runs. Each flow cycle will output timestamp-marked foler containing the following file structure: 

```
designs/<design_name>

│   │       └── synthesis
```

## Flow configuration

1. PDK / technology specific
2. Flow specific
3. Design specific

- A PDK should define at least one variant for the PDK. A common configuration file for all PDK variants is located in:

    ```
    $PDK_ROOT/$PDK/config.tcl
    ```

    - Sometimes the PDK comes with several Standard Cell Libraries or Metal Stacks. Each is considered as a PDK variant. A variant configuration file defines extra variables specific to the variant. It may also override variables in the common PDK configuration file which is located in:

        ```
        $PDK_ROOT/$PDK/$PDK_VARIANT/config.tcl
        ```
    - More on configuring a new PDK in this [section](#setting-up-a-pdk)

- Flow specific variables are related to the flow and are initialized with default values in:

    ```
    ./configuration/
    ```

- Finally, each design should have it's own configuration file with some required variables which are available in this [list][17]. A design configuration file may override any of the variables defined in PDK or flow configuration files. This is the global configurations for the design:

    ```
    ./designs/<design>/config.tcl
    ```
    - More on design configurations in [here](./designs/README.md)

A list of all available variables can be found [here][17].


## Interactive Mode
You may run the flow interactively by using the `-interactive` option:

```
./flow.tcl -interactive
```

A tcl shell will be opened where the openlane package is automatically sourced:
```
% package require openlane 0.9
```

Then, you should be able to run the following commands:

0. Any tcl command.
1. `prep -design <design> -tag <tag> -config <config> -init_design_config -overwrite` similar to the command line arguments, design is required and the rest is optional
2. `run_synthesis` 
3. `run_floorplan`
4. `run_placement`
5. `run_cts`
6. `run_routing`
7. `run_magic`
8. `run_magic_spice_export`
9. `run_magic_drc`
10. `run_netgen`
11. `run_magic_antenna_check`


The above commands can also be written in a file and passed to `flow.tcl`:

```
./flow.tcl -interactive -file <file>
```

**Note 1:** Currently, configuration variables have higher priority over the above commands so if `RUN_MAGIC` is 0, command `run_magic` will have no effect. 

**Note 2:** Currently, all these commands must be run in sequence and none should be omitted.

# Regression And Design Configurations Exploration

As mentioned earlier, everytime a new design or a new (PDK,PDK_VARIANT) pair is added, or any update happens in the flow tools, a re-configuration for the designs is needed. The reconfiguration is methodical and so an exploration script was developed to aid the designer in reconfiguring his designs if needed.
As explained [here](#adding-a-design) that each design has multiple configuration files for each (PDK,PDK_VARIANT) pair.

## Overview
OpenLANE provides `run_designs.py`, a script that can do multiple runs in a parallel using different configurations. A run consists of a set of designs and a configuration file that contains the configuration values. It is useful to explore the design implementation using different configurations to figure out the best one(s). 

Also, it can be used for testing the flow by running the flow against several designs using their best configurations. For example the following run: spm using its default configuration files `config.tcl.` :
```
python3 run_designs.py --designs spm xtea md5 aes256 --tag test --threads 3
```

For more information on how to run this script, refer to this [file](./Regression_Exploration.md)

For more information on design configurations, how to update them, and the need for an exploration for each design, refer to this [file](./designs/README.md)
